## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework

### What I learned

I experimented with the new app directory in NextJs 13. Additionally, i continued to improve my understanding of typescript.

### Continued development

I intend to undertake a course on backend development to help improve my understanding of backend development.

### Useful resources

- [Nextjs](https://nextjs.org/) - This helped me understand some of the features of nextjs and their new updates.
- [React Docs](https://beta.reactjs.org/) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand the basic concepts of react. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
